"The April 2025 Coupon Book has a few exciting deals this month! First of all, the Kerrygold Pure Irish Butter yearly sale is back! This is the time Costco members will stock up and freeze a bunch to last them throughout the year. At $3.90 off it’s quite a deal! The Woozoo fan has been extremely popular with Costco members for a long time, so if you’ve held off for the last few years, this might just be the time to cave in at $10 off! We’ve never tried the Royal Asia Prawn Hacao, but keep hearing great things about them. At $4 off we’re going to be awfully tempted. The April tire coupon has switched back to Michelin and is $40 off a set $899.99 or less and $60 off a set $900.00 or more.",The,$3.90,$3.90,
