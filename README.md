Since the project needs the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) python will be perfect for data extraction. 
First trial will be with an image and see if the data is aligned as per the provided format

Tools required
1. Python
2. Libraries 
    a. pytesseract - for google ocr engine
    b. pillow - for handling images
    c. openCV - for preporecessing images
    d. Scrapy - ibrary to scrape the data from the specified website and save it to a CSV file.

Decided to go with webscrapping on day two to try and ease the process
